<h1 class=header>List of Modifications</h1>

<p>
	The purpose of this page is to list all of the changes that have been made to the Stanford C++ libraries over time.
	These changes have been made primarily by current unofficial maintainer, Marty Stepp.
	Listing those changes here can help current developers and users of the library track down problems or issues that arise due to new or missing functionality.
