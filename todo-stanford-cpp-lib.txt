x	LIB HASH BUG: I think we found a bug in HashMap::deepCopy() in the LaIR today. The method looks like:
x		void deepCopy(const HashMap& src) {
x			createBuckets(src.nBuckets);
x			for (int i = 0; i < src.nBuckets; i++) {
x				for (Cell* cp = src.buckets.get(i); cp != NULL; cp = cp->next) {
x					put(cp->key, cp->value);
x				}
x			}
x		}
x		For each bucket, it goes through its corresponding linked list in src, and inserts each element in the _front_ of the new list. So the new list is in reverse order. It's mostly fine since every element is still in the correct bucket, but the hash code for the old and the new maps are different, because hash code calculation depends on the order of the elements. So in the student's code, two HashMaps are equal but have different hash values. I manually copied the linked list in order, and the issue was resolved.

x			http://pisoft.ru/verstak/insider/cw_seh.htm
x		iterators returning value vs const ref?
x			Anyway, I had a minor issue with the iterators for Map, HashMap, Set, and HashSet. Right now, operator* returns ValueType (or KeyType), but it should probably return const ValueType& (or const KeyType&).
x			Basically, the current iterator forces a copy even when you don't want one, which'll especially come up with a range-based for, such as:
x				for (const std::string& movieName : mMovieToActorsMap) {
x					// code
x				}
x			With the current versions of those four classes, this code gives you a const reference to a copy of the string, which is both wasteful and can cause real issue if you want to save this reference.

x			resize but keep contents!  (pass 'true' flag?)
-		make filelib isBinaryFile, isTextFile functions  (from hw6 autograder cpp)
-			this test is very flawed; lots of complexity here and my functions work for HW6 but are too dumb for general use
x		fix foreach.h; is foreach macro broken in my version of library?
x			I just wanted to alert you to a potential issue with the autograder that I just uncovered. When a student's code has #include "foreach.h" in it, the autograder won't work. Changing her foreaches to be range-based and removing the #include seemed to work, but you may want to look into it or at least mention it on the Wiki.
x		standardize Author: vs @author
x		hashCode for graph, basicgraph, sparsegrid, etc.? hashset, hashmap, set, map? other types?
x				map, hashmap, pqueue, queue, stack, grid, sparsegrid, etc.?
x			requires ==, != on all collections
x				equals
x				equals should check this == &other
x			make them friend functions so that they're fast for stacks etc.?  don't make entire backup of collection, ick
x				stack
x					also equals, <</tostring
x				queue
x					also equals, <</tostring
x			does adding hashCode break ability to add things to a Grid, PQ, etc. that do not themselves have a hashCode function?
x				e.g. PriorityQueue<Student>
x				idea: optional compiler flag that enables such functionality?  included in my .pro, not by default?
x			HashMap< HashSet<Vector<string> >, Vector<string> > N_gram;
x		Deque class?
~		reimplement Vector, etc. using STL versions as underlying container?
x			Vector
x			Stack
x			Queue
x			LinkedList
x		strlib: always accept const string&   (also do this elsewhere?)
x		go through all Foo.cpp, make sure foo.h is first include, to ensure that its includes are complete
x		grep whole codebase for things without std::
x		check headings for iostream, sstream, fstream, string
x		figure out for: vs. __foreach__ in all collections
x		provide add(), remove() for ALL collections
x			map
x			hashmap
x			stack
x			queue
x			pq
x		get rid of hashCode int, double, etc. forms, just have one template
x		BUGBUG: GOptionPane can barf when you pass a message with , or other special chars?
x		BUGBUG: File_openFileDialog crashes?  repro?  fix?
x			test it with empty path  (NPEx?)
x			test it with a complex path (does it handle /, \, :, etc.?)
-		integrate Google Test and other autograder stuff into main lib build?
-			pro:
-				all one build, easier to keep track of / maintain
-			con:
-				licensing issues?
-				takes longer to do a full rebuild?
-				larger download?  MUCH longer
-				security issues, students seeing autograder code?
-				obligation to have cleaner, better commented code?
-			conclusion:
-				don't include; too messy and depends too much on GoogleTest
		
		docs: what's missing?
			replace 'method' with 'function'
			observable.h   - document
			regexpr.h      - document
			collection Javaey methods - document
				addAll
				removeAll
				retainAll
				operators: +, +=, ==, !=, etc.
x			& on reference params, * on pointers
x			<> in page titles
x			gbufferedimage
x		any old TODOs?
